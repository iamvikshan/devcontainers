# 🎯 Quick Solution Summary

## Your Problem
You want to revert your main branch to a specific commit that appears to not belong to any branch.

## ✅ The Truth
**The commit `719a525424a695c1931b72a55a7197fa177e6707` DOES belong to the main branch!**

The "grafted" status you see just means the repository history was rewritten at some point (which is normal).

## 🚀 Quick Solution

### To revert main to the current main commit (719a525):
```bash
./revert_main_branch.sh 719a525424a695c1931b72a55a7197fa177e6707
```

### To revert main to a different commit:
```bash
# First, find the commit you want
./find_orphaned_commits.sh

# Then revert to it
./revert_main_branch.sh <your_target_commit_hash>
```

### To just analyze the situation:
```bash
# Check repository status
./revert_main_branch.sh --status

# Find potentially orphaned commits
./find_orphaned_commits.sh
```

## 📋 What the Scripts Do

1. **`revert_main_branch.sh`** - Safe, guided main branch revert with backups
2. **`find_orphaned_commits.sh`** - Find and analyze commits that appear disconnected
3. **`MAIN_BRANCH_REVERT_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed documentation with all options

## ⚡ One-Liner Commands

```bash
# Quick status check
./revert_main_branch.sh --status

# Revert main to current remote main
./revert_main_branch.sh 719a525

# Get help
./revert_main_branch.sh --help
